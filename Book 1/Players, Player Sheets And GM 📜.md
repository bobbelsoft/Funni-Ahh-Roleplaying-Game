Before starting, Assign a “GM/FM” (Game-Master/Farg-Master, both mean the same), get the most unbiased person and the person should also be good/creative in the following sectors

- Fast thinking to what players do
- World Building 🌐
- Voices 📢
- Unbiased towards Players And Monsters
- Does not give any extra mercy
- Can Make And Describe Detailed environments & NPCs
- Can make a map
- Is Unbiased
- Is Unstingy
- Can Make Monster sheets
- Does Have Quite some free time & motivation

The Following person is called “GM”

## Players 👥

The players are the people who play in the GM’s story & world, they consist of 3-4 players (Recommended) or 2-6 players (Not Recommended) who are creative and can integrate their own stories with other player, are unstingy and do not lie (very hard requirements, i know)

while players cannot control how many points (power) they can have, they can control where those points are spent more on %%link page Here%%

They can also get a basic weapon that resembles their character, more about that in %%insert area here%%

Make sure to remember the following: IF A PLAYER KNOWS ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT ANOTHER PLAYER’S CHARECTER DOES NOT MEAN THE PLAYER’S CHARECTER KNOWS ABOUT, THE PLAYER AND CHARECTER ARE 2 SEPERATE ENTITIES SO EXAMPLE: If Player A (PA) knows a secret about the character of Player B (PB) does not mean the character of PA knows about the secret as well.

Players can also control their character appearance, their preferences, name, history (if it makes sense and is not like “Oh I WaS A SuPeR NukE BaCk ThEN AnD The MosT PoWErFuL BeiNg AnD StiLl Am”) (i mean if someone does that then just make overpowered enemies?)

## Character Sheets 👤 → 📜 → 🧙‍♂️

Character sheets represent your in game character

WARNING: IT IS HIGHLY RECCOMENDED TO WRITE YOUR CHARACTER SHEET WITH A PENCIL OR PAPER ON WHICH IT CAN BE ERASED ON EASILY (or y’know, just do it online)

_(Make Sure To Make Your Character Sheet readable)_

There are many ways to make a character sheet, here is one example
