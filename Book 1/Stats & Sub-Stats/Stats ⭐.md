Stats decide how powerful a character is, like D&D, Fallout, Baldurâ€™s Gate 3

So there are 2 types of stats, base stats and sub stats

Base stats

Base stats are numbers that directly affect your character

Sub-Stats

Sub-Stats Are stats that are affected by base-stats, they are usually spells and stuff like that

For example: Wisdom is a main stat, while perception is a sub stat that bases it off wisdom, first of all, to gain perception, you need to have a minimum wisdom, this can vary on how your dm assigned the number to reach acquiring spells

While perception is something that is acquired, Wisdom is a stat that each character has at the beginning of the game/campaign

so if perception takes up like 3 of wisdom units in other words

wisdom:3 will be then = to perception:1

similarly if wisdom is 6 perception can have 2

they are directly proportional

some stats could be indirectly proportional as well which could result in the weaking of the sub stat

so if perception is 3, then it adds a modifier to add +1 to a roll of perception

## 3.2 Understanding Stats and what they do ðŸ’›

Your stats are directly affected by your class, For example: mages would start with extra +1 Intellect And a Tank would start +1 Defense. But a mage will have way less HP then a tank

### Health:

Most characters start with 100 HP and each +1 point putten into health adds 10 HP to that character 

Eg. If Health = 5 then HP MAX is 150 *depends on which system you use, read below*
*Before you start your campaign, make sure to decide if constitution and health is the same thing and health should be replaced by constitution or not, if you decide that both are different stats and constitution only handles things like extreme weather, fatigue, poison, etc, then also decide on a system when will you roll for constitution in extreme weather after how much time, poison, how many turns, etc.. , you could also make constitution and health into one singular stat and also handle  extreme weather, fatigue, poison, and health*


### Intellect is the ability on how accurately u can recall things or the ability to reason. Example: conversing in a foreign language.

### Magic: your ability to use spells and decides how many mana you have, and how well can you can cast spells. 1 magic = 20 Mana 
*you can modify this number and make it 10 if you wish to, but you cannot change this midgame*

### Strength: is how well your muscles are and how active you are, this affects how much you can carry as weight

### Charisma: your ability to persuade creatures, Eg. Persuading a shopkeeper from reducing a price from 500 to 350

### Wisdom measures a character's practical intelligence, their cleverness, their perceptiveness, and how in tune they are with the world around them. Characters with high Wisdom are perceptive, observant, and sensible.
### dexterity: your ability in how fast u move around and agile.

## Constitution: Determines how much health you have: so for example:

1 constitution = 10 health *depending on which system you use, read below to understand more*

it also determines if you can handle extreme weather, fatigue, poison, etcâ€¦
*Before you start your campaign, make sure to decide if constitution and health is the same thing and health should be replaced by constitution or not, if you decide that both are different stats and constitution only handles things like extreme weather, fatigue, poison, etc, then also decide on a system when will you roll for constitution in extreme weather after how much time, poison, how many turns, etc.. , you could also make constitution and health into one singular stat and also handle  extreme weather, fatigue, poison, and health*

Those were all the Base Stats, but Sub-stats work quite differently so here is how sub stats work [[Sub Stats ðŸŒŸ]]
