Sub-Stats are stats that add to a base stat roll

Eg. (without sub-stats) you roll a insight check, your wisdom stat is: Wisdom= 6 (+2)

you get a 12 on your roll and add 2, so you get a 14

But for example you have insight, your insight stat is: insight = 4 (+1) and that +1 will affect the roll and make it a 15

Some substats are also able to add to spells or skills/ special attacks etc…

So now we should at the end of book 1, our main page look like this

<insert image here>

This is the end of Chapter 1/Book 1 where you learned character personalization, stats, substats, player sheets, Players and GM

In other chapter you’ll learn levelling up, combat system, Monster, Big Bad and more

<what if when you contribute 1 base stat point into a substat you get 2 instead of 1 or maybe a level system for each base stat and reaching a certain level upgrades a substat or what if you just remove substats and base those skills only on base stats?>
