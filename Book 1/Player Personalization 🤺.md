Players have full control over their character but whatever the character likes, dislikes, acts like, looks, voice, alignment, and, history and etc… the characters must act like those so for example:

Eg. Player “A” (Or also known as P.A) made his character a…

- Lawful Good 
- Paladin
- Likes sweets
- Is not arrogant, etc…

So, P.A must make his character act like those

Players can theoretically hide what their character from the GM so like for example they say “My character is a tall guy in a coat” but its actually just 2 small dwarves in a coat and its not known until something happens in the story that reveals it, looking at other’s character sheet is not allowed unless suspected of cheating

(also the name can be anything, so the class and species and etc…, just… fairly powered?)

The Player can also design a weapon for their character, but while they can decide the abilities, it must be fairly powered

So for Example: (P.B) made a character who is a

True Neutral

Elf who used to be a professional cook

And is a supporter class

So he made a magical weapon which is a pan which can always have perfect heat to cook food (make food, spells to support his team)

Oh, and 1 Last thing before you go to the next page, always remember:
Just because a player knows something about another player does not mean the character knows it as well

Aight but what is “true neutral” & “Lawful Good” and alignments?
