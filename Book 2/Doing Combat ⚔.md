there can be multiple ways to do combat, you can even make your own, however make sure to decide a system before starting a campaign and stick with it

## Action Point System [2/5✨]

This system relies on another number factor called A.Points (Known as A.P) which will let you do your moves

so here is an example:

P2 here is playing as an mage, they have 3 A.P, they cast fireball which takes 1 A.P and 40 mana to a radius of 5 meters, he can take 1 turn which can require 1 A.P or more

%%make make sure to remember on how to regen mana and make a system for non mana users to attack something like the dilmek skill%%

You can add A.P limits, E.g: you can only use 2 A.P per turn on keep it as a curse or something?

2.4.3.2: How to regain A.P? [✨?/5]

you can add spells, conditions on how to regain S.P, for example, this is an example below:

“You regain 1 A.P Each Turn” or something like that

2.4.3.3: How Much A.P does a player start with? ✨ = ?

It can vary from player count and difficulty but here is an example:

|Players:|How much A.P received at the start for each player

| 1   | 4/5 |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 2/3 |
| 3   | 2/1 |
| 4   | 1   |


-------------------------------------------------------------

2.4.3.4: How to get S.P? ✨ + = ?

Since S.P is a valuable resource, the GM can make it hard to get so it could be for example:

Reaching a high level like 20

Defeating a boss

Getting some hard to get achievement like “get 40 spells”

2.4.3.5: Do monsters have S.P

Depends on the system you are using, if you wish to, you can give the monsters S.P or you can not, its your choice

## The "WWTLTUAPS" System 
The "We were to lazy to use a proper system" system is a very simple and bare bones system, it requires the following dies: d20.

to start combat you do the initiative thing and then tell what you want to do and roll, depending on the roll noomber the GM will tell what happened, also here is a scuffed chart

| Noomber | Definition                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Critical Failure                               |
| 2-3     | Big Failure                                    |
| 4-6     | Fail                                           |
| 7-9     | Passed Barely With Some Small thing gone Wrong |
| 10-15   | Passed with no reprecussions                   |
| 16-18   | Pass But Better                                |
| 19      | Great Pass                                     |
| 20      | Crit Pass                                      |
| 20+     | Read the information below                     |
As you progress, the characters will get better modifiers so changing chart isnt a bad idea to keep it balanced but also give a slight edge, but they will fight more powerful things so eh
