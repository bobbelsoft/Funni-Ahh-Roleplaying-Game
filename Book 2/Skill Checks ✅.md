When you want a player to check something outside of combat, its called a skill check, you tell the player to roll a d20 and see with the following result

As you progress, the characters will get better modifiers so changing chart isn't a bad idea to keep it balanced but also give a slight edge, but they will be doing more powerful things so eh
