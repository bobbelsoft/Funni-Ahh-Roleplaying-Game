_{_Its been a while since i worked on this game, many months infact, so if something feels off, well expect it_}_

The BASICSYS or also known as “B.S” is the more simple basic system for combat and the game

When the players enter battle, all of the players roll initiative, this decides which player/creature starts first. Your DEX modifier applies to this roll (roll d20)

Monsters also roll for initiative and they also have stats, so if a monster got a higher number, they start first (higher roll then the players)

If there is a stalemate in initiative, whichever creature has the higher LvL goes first, if its another stalemate in LvL then choose randomly (using a roll)

Each monster has stats & skills just like players and NPC’s

So for example of a monster and a scenario:

|Creature Name: Dilmek|
|---|
|HP: 60|
|Mana: 0|
|Strength: 3 (+1)|
|Magic: 0|
|Dex: 5|
|Intellect: 3 (+1)|
|Charisma: 1|
|Defense: 2|
|Constitution: 0|
|Lvl 12|
|Skill/Spells: Dilmet Bilmet: Roll a d20, if above 10, do 4 dmg, if below, take 4 dmg, COST: 1 AP AND A STRENGTH ROLL OF ABOVE 8 on d20|

and 3 of these dilmeks attack the squad, if its only 1 enemy type, you roll initiative one time so result is:

dilmek(s): 12

P1: 9

P2: 14

P3: 6

P4: 12

And all of the players are LvL 14 so order would be:

P2 → p4 → Dilmeks → P1 → P3

however if there is another creature (This is for an example so we will not give it stats and simply call it glort)

2 Glort(s) roll 8

1 Dilmek rolls 12

P1: 9

P2: 14

P3: 6

P4: 12

And all of the players are LvL 14 so order would be:

P2 → p4 → Dilmeks → P1 → Glort → P3
