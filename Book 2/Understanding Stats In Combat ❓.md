# Defense üõ°Ô∏è

While you can alter the system or make a new one, you should only use one system in a campaign

## "Example 1 Of Defense System: ‚ÄúThe Def-Sys-Base or simply DB-Sys‚Äù

while you can alter the system and its recommended to, an idea for a system could be something such as: 
Eg. If enemy attacks players, Roll DEF die, if DEF roll bigger then ATK roll from Enemy, reduce Attack by {enemy_defense_If_Atk.Block} by that % 
## Example 2 "The DefEN-Sys-Base*2* or simply DefEN-Sys": 
the enemy attacks "Player.C(P.C)" and rolls a 14, "P.C" rolls a defense die and gets a 16, and the enemy blocks defense rolls by 20%, "P.C" defends 80% atk for a turn (The Player Must Use A A.P to roll a DEF die, no matter outcome) 
However these systems require a lot of math calculations so we can use a system like this 
## Example 3.2.1(Ex Overall 3) "The Discover-Def-Sys":

both sides roll a die and then add modifiers (Defense in defending case, Primary Weapon type use stat in offense case)
