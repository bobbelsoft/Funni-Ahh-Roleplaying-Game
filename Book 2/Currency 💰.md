You can use multiple currencies like gold, silver, iron but the recommended approach is 1 Main currency (for this example we will call it Qubes but you can call it whatever you wish) and for Very Expensive things we can use stat points

There are Many ways to earn qubes however this can vary from world, area and campaign, for this example below, we are in a old-sort medieval magical setting, so a few examples are but not limited to:

- Doing Quests
- Selling Stuff
- Uhhh i forgor, (might change this later)

with money you can buy stuff (insane) such as fud (which you need to survive), living, weapons, spells and more

anyways moving on too [[Making Monsters On the Basic System And Starting Combat ðŸ‘º]]
