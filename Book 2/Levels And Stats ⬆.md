Players obviously need a way to get stat points [or maybe you don’t, cool, we get it, you’re trying to look skilled] , So, levels are a viable way

There are many ways to earn XP such as doing quests, doing exploration, defeating monsters or bosses and more

If your GM and if the players have a lot of time and are dedicated enough, you can make your own level table and rewards for reaching a certain level, it could be spells, weapons, items and more

While you can keep any number of XP you want for each level to be achieved and any reward for reaching that level, it is recommended to balance it so for example, the table below is very scuffed but its an example:

|LEVEL 0 XP: 0 (YOU START HERE)|~|
|---|---|
|LEVEL 1: 200XP|+1 Sp|
|LEVEL 2: 450XP|+1 Sp|
|LEVEL 3: 699XP (yes)|+1sp+1 Sub-Stat Point|
|LEVEL 4: 850XP|+1sp|
|LEVEL 5: 1010XP|+1Sp+ Level 1 basic utility spell or item|
|LEVEL 6: 1650|+1Sp|
|LEVEL 7: 1999|+1Sp|
|LEVEL 8: 2550|+1Sp|
|LEVEL 9: 3100|+1Sp|
|LEVEL 10: 3750|+1Sp+ Level 2 combat spell/ main class spell/ item (sword, catalyst, gun, etc…)|

While this is a scuffed system, it does give an example, it is recommended to make your own levelling system as such like this

(Sp = Stat point)

You could also theoretically use Sp as a currency so Eg. This Legendary Artifact Costs Lives (- 50 hp or 5 hp stat points)

Anyways, moving on to next is <insert currency link here>
